                    Shakespeare often comes to mind when thinking of Western poetry. Despite his incredible additions to the literary world, he was not the first great pioneer of Western literature, not even in the case of poetry. The Romans before him, some of the most literate people in the ancient world, produced their own plethora of poetry in Latin. Their works are often an underappreciated cultural element which should not be lost to time. Below are just some samples of the rich world of Roman poetry, including works from the classics such as Ovid, Tacitus, and Cicero.

            <p>Publius Ovidius Naso (43 BC - 17/18 AD), more commonly known as Ovid (that is, if you don't prefer his epic Latin moniker, which is admittedly a mouthful), was a great Roman poet who lived in the reign of Caesar Augustus. He is well known for his array of love poetry, and is even said to be the first poet to make a literary connection between poetry and romance, using the medium of poetry itself as a method of describing the nature of love far before Shakespeare. The title of his most famous poem, “Love and War,” remains iconic today.

            <p>Gaius (or Publius) Cornelius Tacitus (55 - 120 AD) is often called the greatest historian of ancient Rome. During a time where history was rarely recorded at all, Tactitus provides a wealth of information about the ancient world through his two main works: "the Annals" and "the Histories." Both of these have provided us with a wealth of information about the later years of the Roman Empire under rulers such as Tiberius, Claudius, and Nero. The First Jewish-Roman War is also mentioned. However, there is one particular Jew which Tacitus draws some attention to: Jesus Christ.

            <p>There's no doubt that Marcus Tullius Cicero (106 BC - 43 BC) was an overall prolific figure in Roman history. He was a statesman in the Roman Senate, a lawyer, scholar, as well as an excellent writer with legendary speech-giving skills. In fact, he is considered the best Roman orator of all time. His many writings mostly focus on political and philosophical rhetoric. One of his works, titled "On the Extremes of Good and Evil," has had one of its sections jumbled into gibberish Latin text in order to form the famous sample text: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
