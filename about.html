        Summary 
    </h1>
        <p>
            This website is dedicated to the preservation and appreciation of ancient Latin literature of various genres, which has formed much of the basis for future literature, especially in the Western world. I felt as though, while more modern authors are given their due respect, the ancient authors who we owe so much to have gone criminally underappreciated and ignored. This website intends to do the old Romans at least some justice. Specifically, it contains excerpts from the works of Ovid, Tacitus, and Cicero, all of whom represent the variety of great Roman literature, Ovid being a poet, Tacitus being a historian, and Cicero being a political and philosophical orator. These great works dispel the modern fallacy that ancient people were unintelligent, unenlightened, and completely superstitious fools. Rather, they were just as intelligent, if not more intelligent, than we are. </p>

            <br>

            <p>The other reason why this website is dedicated to such a niche topic is that the “Lorem ipsum…” sample text actually has its origins in a Latin poem by Cicero, although the text has been jumbled up to mean nonsense. It is a developer inside-joke, which is now  unfunny, because I explained it. There are also other jokes throughout this website, so please excuse the lack of professionalism, although they're all work appropriate!</p>
